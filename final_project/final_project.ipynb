    "In this project, we will investigate a subset of the restaurants and related information from them adapted from Yelp data located in San Francisco, California. You will first explore some of the data about the restaurants themselves, calculating some summary statistics and trying to figure out some patterns in the data. Next we will merge that with a list of health inspection scores and violations that have been [made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health](https://data.sfgov.org/Health-and-Social-Services/Restaurant-Scores-LIVES-Standard/pyih-qa8i). Lastly, we will run some linear regression analysis to see if there is any meaningful relationship between health inspection scores, and other aspects of each restaurant\n",
