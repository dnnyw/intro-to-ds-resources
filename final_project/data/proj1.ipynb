    "Let's figure out which restaurants had the lowest scores. Let's start by creating a new dataframe called `ins_named`. It should be exactly the same as `ins`, except that it should have the name and address of every business, as determined by the `bus` dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*: Use the merge method to join the `ins` dataframe with the appropriate portion of the `bus` dataframe. See the official [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html) on how to use `merge`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: For quick reference, a pandas 'left' join keeps the keys from the left frame, so if ins is the left frame, all the keys from ins are kept and if a set of these keys don't have matches in the other frame, the columns from the other frame for these \"unmatched\" key rows contains NaNs.\n",

    "This is a left skewed distribution. The tail is on the left. It looks almost as if it is 1/2 of a normal curve. The mode is 100, which makes sense since a lot of restaurants probably are great with inspections. There tends to be no gaps in the lower scoring range, indicating that the inspectors use every single number they can grade these restaurants. In the higher ranges, it appears that the inspectors have a irrational fear of odd numbers larger than 95. There are no restaurants that are graded 95, 97, or 99, perhaps these numbers look weird. It is strange that, keeping this in mind, they do however choose to grade restaurants 91 and 93, which doesn't quite make sense. I think this kind of implies that up to a certain level, the gradings are all kinda the same, and maybe it's just semantics. This is corroborated by how there is almost a jump from the 80s to the 90s.\n",

    "Let's figure out which restaurants had the worst scores ever (single lowest score). Let's start by creating a new dataframe called `ins_named`. It should be exactly the same as ins, except that it should have the name and address of every business, as determined by the bus dataframe. If a `business_id` in ins does not exist in bus, the name and address should be given as `NaN`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: Use the merge method to join the ins dataframe with the appropriate portion of the bus dataframe. See the official documentation on how to use merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: For quick reference, a pandas left join keeps the keys from the left frame, so if ins is the left frame, all the keys from ins are kept and if a set of these keys don't have matches in the other frame, the columns from the other frame for these \"unmatched\" key rows contains NaNs.\n",

    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",

    "\n",
    "I do observe a positive trend between first score and second scores, however the trend line's slope appears to be roughly 1 if not a little bit less than 1 (can't be sure without plotting it). The slope allows us to roughly predict what your second score will likey be based on what your first score is. My observations are somewhat consistent with my expectations. The slope is roughly 1, which means that chances are your score isn't going to change much. The slope could also be slightly less than 1, which would indicate that it is likely your score will drop on your second inspection. However, assuming the slope is around 1, whatever your first score is, your second score will be predicted to be roughly the same as well.\n",

    "If a restaurant's score improves, there would be an additional entry on the on the right side of the histogram, as it would indicate a single positive difference. Where it goes in the histogram would depend on what the difference was, as that would be which bin it goes. From the plot, I observe that the vast majority of differences resulting in roughly zero change, with the second largest amount having a slight negative chnge. This is the same as my explanation for the previous answer, where it's likely that your second inspection will have either no change if not a slight negative change. \n",

    "In the language of statistics, the distribution of score differences is centered around zero with a spread that spans roughly from -20 to 20. Most of the deviations from the center are within 10 units, with almost 90% of the data in difference between the inspection scores lying between -10 and 10. The mode of the distribution is zero, with the amount of data to the left and the right roughly about the same, indicating that the median is roughly zero as well. "

    "To wrap up our analysis of the restaurant ratings over time, one final metric we will be looking at is the distribution of restaurant scores over time. Create a side-by-side boxplot that shows the distribution of these scores for each different risk category from 2017 to 2019. Use a figure size of at least 12 by 8.\n",

It is meant to group restaurants by location and see if certain locations tend to have more violations than others. The first three columns indicate the ratio of a certain type of violation to the number of restaurants, and then the total represents the total ratio of violations to restaurants. It's then sorted by ratio of violations to number of restaurants. What is interesting is that 94121, the highest ratio, represents the Richmond district in San Francisco, which is majority residential.  "

    "# One question I wanted to answer was how were inspection scores distibuted throughout the city. Since we were given coordinate data for each restaurant, I used that to make a scatter plot based on their longitudinal and latitudeinal location, and then applied a colormap to visualize how their scores were distributed. These scores are calculated as their median score, as it gives an overall representation of their food safety, rather than just their most recent or average score, and accounts for outliers. By looking at this, we can see if theres a association between location and food safety, and consider potential reasons for why clumps of restaurants have lower than average scores. In the process of this, many restaurants were cut out, such as those who did not post their longitude and latitude. This is a problem that would benefit from a deeper look during the data cleaning process, such as maybe cross referencing their address to a longitude and latitude in order to have greater breadth of data.
